# Tests
 Directory of test Builds for different projects

### Note
While these test builds are not quite power hungry, they are in an alpha stage of development and may contain minor to severe flaws in the code. These flaws are capable of freezing the application, affect audio hardware (volume should be set to 0 before testing), and in worst cases, unclosed streams and memory that has not been deallocated may cause memory leak. These issues are still quite rare. Please test at your own risk.
